#What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course? It was a challenge to complete the coursework while also learning the necessary coding. However, I find it rewarding to study the code and finish the modules.

#How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand. I examine the code and attempt to figure out what the software is trying to do. I methodically manipulate and problem-solve my way toward a solution. When I need a more in-depth explanation, I turn to YouTube.

#How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project? When things start to go wrong when I'm working on a project or activity. In order to return to the tasks at hand the following day with a clear head, I often take a break for the night. Alternatively, if I need additional background on the issue, I'll go over to YouTube.

#How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs? Sure enough, I picked up some new coding tricks that I want to put to good use. Projects and exercises demonstrate many methods of attack, including linked lists, binary search trees, and vector sorting.

#How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Learning to write good code is an ongoing endeavor. In spite of this, I am always refining my approach. However, I become energized when my code is easily modified, understood, and adapted to new tasks. Indeed, this is a test, but I eagerly anticipate each week's new installment. It also helps this individual read and comprehend my work without any problems
